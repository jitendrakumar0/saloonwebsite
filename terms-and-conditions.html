                                        Saloon allows users to make both cash and online payments for the services. Cash Payments: Customers, when requesting for an appointment, can choose the 'Pay at Counter' option and make the payment at the venue. However, in the case of “Salon at Home” services, cash payments are not applicable. Customers can only make the online payments (in advance) to book their appointments.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <span class="px-3 py-2 bg-theme1 text-white bg-opacity-50">Online Payments</span>

                                        Customers, when requesting for an appointment, can choose the 'Pay Online' option to make advance payment for the service.
                                        <br><br>
                                        In this case, Saloon will collect the payment on behalf of the relevant partner and share a Payment Receipt (not Tax Invoice) with the user. For online transactions, Saloon collects required financial information (such as your debit or credit number, CVV number, and expiration date) as required for payment processing. However, for safety reasons, we do not store the data. As mentioned in the previous section, online payment during the time of booking is the only mode of payment in case of “Salon at Home” Services.
